# SpaceDex | PAMAL MANGAT 

Welcome to SpaceDex! 
This is my first GitHub repo and i'm happy you found it! 
This is a open-source python 3.8 project for those interested in space. 
We will work with some data and facts about planets and space, and parsing that data we will create a python script
that the user can interact with! 

We will perform tasks such as JSON parsing (information on the planets in our solar system) and displaying that data either through the console, or a tkinter GUI applciation. This project is still early in the works, so feel free to contribute and suggest ideas! Lets get coding!
